# DATASETS FOR LINEAR REGRESSION EXERCISES

All datasets were found [here](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/regression/regression.html) (Access at May 17th, 2020) I have just "translated" them to CSV format so my fellow students can easily import them to their codes. I hope it has some use for you ðŸ˜ƒ.
